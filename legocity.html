<img src="lego.jpg"  style="width: 150px;height:150px"> 

<p> this meme originated in febuary 2020 when Grandayy announced it the meme of the month. 
<br>the lego city meme was about a new ad for the lego city rescue helicopter set. 
<br>people started making memes about it, rearranging the words around, putting words from other lego city ads in them, etc. 
<br>the meme started dying at the end of the month and poeple made memes about a man has died in lego city. 
<br><br>the dialouge for this meme is: 
<br>"A man has fallen into the river in Lego city! start the new rescue helicopter!" 
<br>"HEY"
<br>"Build the helicopter and off to the rescue! prepare the lifeline, lower the strecher, and make the rescue! 
<br>the new emergency collection from lego city! </p>
